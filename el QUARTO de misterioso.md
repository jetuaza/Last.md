# Defensive Cyberspace Methodologies
The purpose of __Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO)__ is to halt adversary offensive initiative, sustain/regain friendly initiative, and if required, create conditions for a counteroffensive. __DCO is threat specific and network-agnostic__, while general __DODIN operations are network focused and threat-agnostic.__ Objectives for the DCO include:
* Deter, Deny, and/or defeat adversary OCO
* Gain time
* Defend critical assets
* Control key terrain in Cyberspace (KT-C)

### Components of DCO
1. __Internal Defensive Measures (DCO-IDM):__ Defensive actions to dynamically reconfirm/reestablish the security of degraded, compromised, or otherwise threatened DOD cyberspace.
2. __Response Actions (DCO-RA):__ Actions taken external to the defended network.

## Cyber Protection Team (CPT)
CPTs mission is to conduct survey, security, and protection actions to prepare local cyberspace defenders to sustain an advanced cyberspace defense posture that protects the commander's critical assets and MRT-C. The __two core tasks__ of CPTs are to __transform and improve defenses__ and __identify and protect key terrain in cyberspace.__

__Defensive Steps__
* __Network Maps:__ CPTs using network maps to verify devices on the network, and how/what they're communicating.
* __Risk Mitigation Plan (RMP):__ No later than 30 days from the outbrief, CPTs create a risk mitigation plan to give to networks to update and further secure their networks.
* __Mission Defense Plan (MDP):__ Making sure that RMPs are implemented correctly.

__Capabilities__
1. __Discovery and Counter Infiltration (D&CI):__ To detect and defeat discovered/previously unknown threats within a secured network/system.
2. __Cyber Threat Emulation (CTE):__ Using known enemy TTPs to replicate real-world threats as a training session. Helps to gain insight into an organization's overall security.
3. __Threat Mitigation:__ Taking/Making mitigation recommendations to reduce the consequences of attacks on specified key terrain.

__Deployable Mission Support System (DMSS):__ Mobile cyber offense/defense support system.
