# Offensive Cyberspace Operations (OCO): Mission intended to project power in and through cyberspace
__ISR in Cyberspace:__ Essentially confirms that we are actually targeting our intended target. 

__Key Terrain in Cyberspace:__ Any space/position that grants one side a considerable advantage over the other.

## Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ-C)
__JFHQ-C Fires:__ Supporting team meant to help coordinate different forces with their targets.

## Requirements/Enablers to Conduct OCO
* Authority
* Access
* Time
* Capability
* Intelligence

### Physical Access
Physical Access is the hardest/weakest part of Cyber operations.
* Human Contact: Sometimes useful or even required to conduct recon or gain access to a target.
* Social Engineering: Psychologically manipulating a target.
* Spear Phishing: Targeting specific individuals, usually those in higher positions of power, with hidden malicious code or with the intent of making them do something.
* Direct Physical Access:

### Logical Access
* Reconnaissance: Gathering information about a target, via Active (direct interation with the target) or Passive (Indirect/No interaction with the target) enumeration.


1. Initial Access: The first action against an information system that someone will take.
2. Obfuscation: Hiding our presence once in the machine.
