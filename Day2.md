# Electromagnetic Spectrum
- The __Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS)__ is a maneuver space essential for maintaining control within the operational environment, and impacts all portions of the OE and military operations.

   Having __Electromagnetic Operational Environment (EMOE)__ superiority is a leading indicator and fundamental component of achieving superiority in the other fighting domains.
### EMOE Complexity
- __Contested:__ Enemy activities detect, disrupt, exploit degrade, deny, deceive, or destroy friendly EMS capabilities for the purpose of military advantage (Fighting for the space).
- __Congested:__ Military and civilian EMS-dependent systems continue to crows the spectrum and increase the amount of unintentional interference (Maneuvering around each other when in each other's space).
- __Constrained:__ Domestic and international regulations control what areas of the EMS military can interfere with.

### Electromagnetic Warfare (EW)
EW includes 3 major subdivisions: Electromagnetic Attack (EA), Electromagnetic Protection (EP), and Electromagnetic Support (ES).
1. __Electromagnetic Attack (EA):__ Consists of Offensive and Defensive attacks.
2. __Electromagnetic Protection (EP):__ Consists of protecting ally forces from enemy attacks.
3. __Electromagnetic Support (ES):__ Consists of gathering information to help with EA or EP situations.

   * __Threat Warning:__ EW personnel employ sensors to detect, intercept, ID, and locate adversary electromagnetic signatures and provide an early warning of an imminent/potential threat.
   * __Direction Finding:__ Leveraging various organic and supporting ES platforms

# Space Operations
__Space Operations__ are operations directly utilizing or impacting space and ground-based capabilities to enhance the potential of the US and its partners.
