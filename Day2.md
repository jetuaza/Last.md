# Electromagnetic Spectrum
- The __Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS)__ is a maneuver space essential for maintaining control within the operational environment, and impacts all portions of the OE and military operations.

   Having __Electromagnetic Operational Environment (EMOE)__ superiority is a leading indicator and fundamental component of achieving superiority in the other fighting domains.
### EMOE Complexity
- __Contested:__ Enemy activities detect, disrupt, exploit degrade, deny, deceive, or destroy friendly EMS capabilities for the purpose of military advantage (Fighting for the space).
- __Congested:__ Military and civilian EMS-dependent systems continue to crows the spectrum and increase the amount of unintentional interference (Maneuvering around each other when in each other's space).
- __Constrained:__ Domestic and international regulations control what areas of the EMS military can interfere with.

### Electromagnetic Warfare (EW)
EW includes 3 major subdivisions: Electromagnetic Attack (EA), Electromagnetic Protection (EP), and Electromagnetic Support (ES).
1. __Electromagnetic Attack (EA):__ Consists of Offensive and Defensive attacks.
2. __Electromagnetic Protection (EP):__ Consists of protecting ally forces from enemy attacks.
3. __Electromagnetic Support (ES):__ Consists of gathering information to help with EA or EP situations.

   * __Threat Warning:__ EW personnel employ sensors to detect, intercept, ID, and locate adversary electromagnetic signatures and provide an early warning of an imminent/potential threat.
   * __Direction Finding:__ Leveraging various organic and supporting ES platforms

# Space Operations
__Space Operations (SO)__ are operations directly utilizing or impacting space and ground-based capabilities to enhance the potential of the US and its partners.
* __Space Situational Awareness (SSA):__ is the foundational, current, and predictive knowledge and characterization of space objects of all aspects of the OE.
* __Space Control__

   * Space control can be split into __Offensive__ and __Defensive__ Space Control, similar to Cyberspace operations.
* __Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)__
* __Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR)__
* __Satellite Communications__

### Space Domain Elements
1. __Ground Segment:__ Consists of ground-based facilities and equipment. Vulnerable to conventional warfighting techniques, since it is a physical thing that can be attacked.
2. __Link Segment:__ Consists of signal coverage. Vulnerable to things such as jamming, spoofing, replay, command intrusion, etc.
3. __Space Segment:__ Involves the operational spacecraft within the space domain. Vulnerable to things such as anti-satellite devices, payload control, command intrusion, and (D)DOS.
> There is also the __User Segment__, which comprises of the user/personal aspect. Vulnerable to things such as spoofing, (D)DOS, malaware, etc.

#### Dimensions of the Space Domain
The dimensions can be split up 3 different ways: __Physical__, __Network__, and __Cognitive__.
1. __Physical:__ The physical environment that is being used.
2. __Network:__ Allows for communication, and how the space capabilities are used.
3. __Cognitive:__ How people actually perceive the capabilities that are available.

#### Threats in Space
1. Nation State Threat
2. Individual/Small Group Threat
3. Non-State Threat
4. Man Made/Natural Hazards

#### Space Mission Assurance - The ability to defend our space capabilities.
1. Defensive Operations
2. Reconstitution
3. Resilience
4. Deterrence

# Cyberspace Operations (CO)
CCDRs use CO to create effects in support of military objectives.

COs use links and nodes located in the physical domain and perform logical functions to create effects first in cyberspace, then in the physical domain as needed.

The goal of __Defensive Cyberspace Operations__ is to defeat the threat of a specific adversary, and return friendly systems back to a non-exploitated state.

### Cyberspace Attack Effects
__Deny:__ To degrade, disrupt, or destroy access to information/space.

__Cyberspace Exploitation:__ Activities to gain intel and support operational prep of the environment for current and future operations via actions like gaining/maintaining access to networks, systems, etc., of the adversary.

# Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC)
The Laws of Armed Conflict are made up of both __International Laws__ and __Treaty Laws__.

The DoD Law of War Program, in conjuction with the Law of War Manual, essentially states how people must respond to accusations of violations of war crimes.

Legally defined, LOACs must have justifications in their actions, and control over how severe the actions are, making sure to minimize damage as much as possible.

### The Principle of Military Necessity
* Prohibits permanently harming/torturing someone during peacetimes
* Cannot justify actions not necessary to achieve the mission goal.
* Generally(??wtf) prohibits targeting of protected persons, such as civilians, persons of high power/authority, etc.
* __Principle of Proportionality:__ Creates obligations to refrain from attacks that aren't equivalent in action/response.
* __Principle of Unnecessary Suffering:__ Also referred to as the __principle of Humanity__, it forbids the employements of methods meant to cause unnecessary suffering.
* __Principle of Distinction:__ Tells parties to distinguish between active combatants of the fight and non-combatants.

### Rules of Engagement
ROEs set the limits of what certain people are/aren't allowed to do.
   * __Standing ROEs:__ Rules that are always followed no matter what.
   * __Specific ROEs:__ Rules that are followed given specific circumstances.
